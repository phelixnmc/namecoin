EasyWinBuilder v0.6 Namecoin Edition
============================
(c) 2014 phelix / blockchained.com - MIT license

Download environment software, all dependencies and build Namecoin automatically. To run simply double click __all_easywinbuilder.bat or manually start the batch files in order. Building on Windows really is a pain. Hopefully this saves people some trouble.

EasyWinBuilder can run on a mint windows system (e.g. a virtual machine) or a normal system. It might overwrite your MinGW or Qt installation, though. Please note the process takes about half an hour or more and will need about 3GB of hard drive space.

To change directories and dependency versions edit set_vars.bat

ToDo
-----
* Automatic environment install (how to bootstrap?)
* Try to speed up building of OpenSSL and Berkeley DB by only building what is necessary
